## Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* MSE (Mean Squared Error)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* R² Score

## Running the Project

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Business Applications

* Algorithmic Trading
* Portfolio Optimization
* Risk Assessment
* Financial Forecasting

## Limitations

* Predictions are based only on historical stock prices.
* External factors such as news sentiment and market events are not considered.
* Long-term forecasts may become less reliable due to recursive prediction errors.

## Future Enhancements

* GRU and Transformer Models
* News Sentiment Analysis
* Real-Time Stock Data Integration
* Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Deep Learning models such as SimpleRNN and LSTM can be applied to time-series forecasting problems. Through data analysis, model comparison, and forecasting capabilities, the system provides insights into Tesla stock price behavior and serves as a foundation for more advanced financial prediction systems.
